"""The effects port: the Controller's writes, sent through the transport, each through the one credential its type
names and nothing else (design sections 3.6 and 4.9; #193's rulings for PR 2, posted 2026-10-21).

`apply` takes the pass's plan, `writes/1`, and the pass record it was planned from, and returns `written/1`: what each
write did, as read back. Before anything is sent the plan is held to the record: the same pass and Release, ids in
order, and every write but a last successor exactly the ones the record's Decisions call for, all of them, in their
order, each dispatch under the run-name its Decision gives it, an approval's under the configuration's owner Role. A
plan that is not the record's is refused whole, and nothing is sent (I-22). The successor alone is not in the record:
it is a dispatch of the poller, which carries nothing.

A dispatch is the pass job's own token's (`WORKFLOW_TOKEN`), whose account the records port counts a Run by (P-9;
#196's ruling 10). Its transport may send nothing but a dispatch of the three workflow files the configuration names,
on its home repo and branch, a Run's or an approval's with its three inputs and the successor's with none. While
the configuration names no account for that token, no Run or approval is dispatched: the records port could not
count it, and the ceilings would not see it (I-34). GitHub answers a dispatch 204 with no run,
so it is `sent`, never `applied`: the next pass's records port reads it back by its run-name. A dispatch is sent once
and never retried, whatever it answers: one GitHub did not answer may still have started a run, and a second would
start a second under the same Run id. A 401 or 403 ends every later write on that credential. An act no write serves
yet is recorded `not_built` and raises nothing.

`python3 -m adapters.effects PASS WRITES OUT` is the step: it reads the pass record and the plan, sends the writes
through a live transport, writes `written.json` to `OUT`, and exits non-zero when a write failed or was refused for
any reason but `not_built`, so that the pass's run concludes where the Maintainer sees it. A plan refused whole, or a
token the transport cannot take, still leaves `written.json`, every write in it refused.
